**Research Goal:** Our goal is to generate a robust ranking system with insights to assist a BNPL firm in deciding which merchants they should accept a partnership with.

In the process we will be answering the following 2 questions:
1. What are the 100 best merchants according to our ranking system?
2. What features or heuristics did we discover that greatly separated which merchants should and shouldn't be accepted?

**Timeline:** The timeline is February 2021-August 2022 based on the transaction data currently available.

To run the pipeline, please visit the `scripts` directory and `notebooks` directory as instructed:
1. `scripts/example.py`: This downloads the data into the ./data/ directory.

Note to groups: Make sure to read the `README.md` located in `./data/README.md` for details.
